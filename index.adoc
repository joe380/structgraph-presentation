== How large is your application?

[.fragment]
Java EE application with over 5000 classes

== Answer this

Which message driven beans depend on singletons?

[.fragment]
That contain a map?

== {sp}

[source,java]
----
@MessageDriven
public class Processor {
  @EJB
  FooService service;

  public void onMessage(Message m) {

  }
}

@Singleton
public class FooService {
  Map<Input, CachedValue> cache;
}
----

== How would you do that in your IDE?

[.fragment]
* Go to definition
* Go to implementation
* Find usages

== structgraph
Your application's structure in graph database

== Ingredients

[%step]
* Cypher: neo4j's powerful graph query and modification language
* Bytecode: only open API to your application structure

== Function
* source
** Walk over jar (ear, war) files and look for class files
* read
** Read the class file with ASM, extract the information
* sink
** Store the information, into neo4j

== What is extracted
* Types
** Inheritance, Annotations
* Fields
** Types, Annotations, Type Parameters
* Methods
** Annotations, Invocations of other methods
** Fields method is invoked upon

== Neo4j data model

image::neo4j-data-model-umlet.svg[]

== Graph scheme

(without additional data)

== Simple queries

----
MATCH (c:Class)-[:hasMethod]->(m:Method)
WHERE m.simpleName = 'toString()'
RETURN c,m
----

== Reading class data

== ClassVisitor, FieldVisitor

== AnnotationVisitor

== Nested annotations

== Annotation based queries

Destinations of message driven beans

Entity Graph

== Modifying data with Neo4j

linkImplementations

== Method invocations

Invocations in JVM
AnalyzerVisitor, finding fields

== Virtual calls

== Virtual calls query

== Structgraph status

== Future directions

== You're welcome to help
